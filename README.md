# Manhunt Fixer

Manhunt Fixer is an automated GUI tool designed to solve various issues present in Manhunt.

It works with any game version, retail and steam.

Solved issues:
- Executable not launching
- Various AI errors and scripts not executing properly (locked gates, wrong enemy behaviour), achieved by limiting framerate to 60FPS
- Fixes end level crashes
- Fixes audio and music loops

Fixer requires internet connection for automatic operation (downloading files).

You can install extra things like PluginMH or Widescreen Frontend textures.

Additionally, widescreen support is improved by integrating Widescreen Fix.
